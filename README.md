This is a [Neo4j Database][neo4j] database containing most of the data

data were collected over a three day period in May 2012 using the

I once wrote a [blog entry about this data][blogentry]. See that entry for more information.
usage rights
------------

It's just data, however it was produced under the auspices of a joint
study agreement between IBM and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln,
therefore the data are licensed are the terms of that agreement which
requires that all output be licensed under the [Apache License v2.0][license].
I'm not certain what that means for data, but that's the rules.

help you make sense of the data). If you're looking for a citation use
